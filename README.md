> Regex101 packaged as an offline Mac OSX application

## [→ Download](https://github.com/aurbano/regex101-osx/raw/master/dist/Regex101.zip)

The app is basically the [offline version](https://github.com/Syskaw/Regex101.com-offline-app) of Regex101, packaged with [MacGap](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1) after adding some changes to it.

## Roadmap
Possible features to work on:

* Growl notifications (for timeouts for example)
* Update notifications (add a json file with the version and compare with the one on Github)
* Application icon
* Native top bar ([NSToolbar](https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap1/wiki/Add-NSToolbar-to-MacGap-application)) with the links in the we header.
* *Any ideas?*
